# semantic_search

Use ```create_index.py``` to create index and to change it's mappings.

Multifield search is performed using the mappings shown in ```current_mappings.png```

Custom static mappings can be defined using ```create_index.py``` and include the same in ```multifield_search.py```  before performing the search.
